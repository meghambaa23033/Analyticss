# Case Overview


The goal is to predict customer satisfaction scores for conversations with a bank's chatbot (Smart Digital Assistant) using conversational data. This is crucial for understanding customer sentiment when explicit feedback is unavailable.

Objective
Classify conversations into three satisfaction levels:

Satisfied
Neutral
Not Satisfied
Dataset
The dataset contains customer-agent conversations with features like:

conversation_id: Unique ID for each conversation.
Speaker: Customer or Agent.
Date_time: Timestamp of each utterance.
Dialogue: Text of the conversation.
Approach
Analyze conversational data to extract features like sentiment, intent understanding, resolution time, and query resolution status.
Use machine learning models (supervised or semi-supervised) to predict satisfaction scores.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and document the process in a Python notebook.

## Features

The code file contains the following features and functionalities:

**Library Imports and Setup**
Imports essential libraries like pandas, numpy, nltk, and visualization abilities (matplotlib, seaborn).
Downloads necessary NLTK data (e.g., punkt for tokenization and stopwords for text preprocessing).

**Dataset Loading:**
Loads the dataset (Conversation_Dataset.csv) into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Displays the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
Provides dataset metadata (e.g., column names, data types, memory usage).
Checks for missing values and duplicate rows in the dataset.

**Text Preprocessing:**
Tokenizes text data and removes stopwords using NLTK.
Prepares the text data for feature extraction and modeling.

**Feature Engineering:**
Extracts features from the conversational data, such as sentiment, speaker type, and time-based features.
Generates additional features to improve model performance.

**Semi-Supervised Learning:**
Implements a semi-supervised learning approach by manually labeling a small subset of data.
Propagates labels to the rest of the dataset using machine learning techniques.

**Visualization:**
Uses heatmaps and other visualizations to compare manually labeled data with propagated labels.
Evaluates the agreement between manual and semi-supervised labels.

**Modeling:**
Prepares the dataset for machine learning by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Trains a machine learning model (e.g., XGBoost or similar) to predict customer satisfaction scores.

**Evaluation:**
Compares the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy or confusion matrices.
Visualizes the results to assess the model's reliability.

**Documentation:**
Includes markdown cells explaining the purpose and interpretation of each code block, making the notebook easy to follow.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Important Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- re
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- gdown



---

## Usage

1. Ensure the dataset file (Conversation_Dataset.csv) is in the same directory as the notebook or provide the correct file path in the code.
If the dataset is not available locally, download it using the provided instructions in the notebook (e.g., using gdown).

2. Open the notebook (Team Cosmic Pegasus-AnalyticsCaseComp.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any compatible editor (e.g., Google Colab).
Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, perform analysis, and train the model.

3. If you prefer running the notebook in Google Colab:

Upload the notebook and dataset to Colab.
Install the required libraries in a Colab cell using !pip install.
Modify the file path for the dataset if necessary.

4. Ensure your Python version is compatible (e.g., Python 3.7 or later). You can check your Python version using: bash python --version

5. Ensure all cells execute without errors.
Address any missing dependencies or dataset issues as they arise.

## Example Input and Output

**Example Inputs**
Dataset Input:
A CSV file named Conversation_Dataset.csv containing the following columns:
conversation_id: Unique ID for each conversation.
speaker: Indicates whether the speaker is the customer or agent.
date_time: Timestamp of each utterance.
text: The actual dialogue or message.


Sample Input Data:
conversation_id          speaker    date_time                       text
2b6544c382e6423b9...     agent      2023-09-06T14:33:33+00:00      Good morning, thank you for calling Union Financial.
2b6544c382e6423b9...     customer   2023-09-06T14:33:41+00:00      Hi, I need help managing my account.
Manually Labeled Data (for semi-supervised learning):


A small subset of the dataset with satisfaction labels:
1: Satisfied
2: Neutral
3: Not Satisfied
Text Data for Preprocessing:
Example: "Hi, I need help managing my account."


**Example Outputs**
Preprocessed Text:
Input: "Hi, I need help managing my account."
Output: ["help", "managing", "account"] (after tokenization and stopword removal).
Feature Extraction:
Input: Conversation data.
Output: Features like sentiment, speaker type, and time-based metrics.
Predicted Satisfaction Scores:
Input: Processed conversation data.
Output: Predicted satisfaction categories:

Example: 1 (Satisfied), 2 (Neutral), 3 (Not Satisfied).
Visualization:
Heatmap comparing manually labeled and propagated labels.
Example Output: A heatmap showing agreement between manual and semi-supervised labels.
Model Evaluation:
Input: Test data.
Output: Metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, or classification report.
These inputs and outputs demonstrate the flow of data through the notebook, from raw input to processed results and predictions.
